 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  The Radio Data Logger project is based on the LUFA TempDataLogger Demo project.
 *  The project is a data logger for the current local temperature and humidity and additional two radio sensors for logging
 *  of distantly temperatures, writing the  measured values to a file stored on the board's Dataflash in a FAT filesystem each
 *  time a specified interval elapses.
 *  When inserted into a PC, the datalogger will appear as a standard USB Mass Storage device with text files for each logging
 *  day, which contains the logged data. Files are named according to the current date of logging. A special PC software written
 *  in Visual C#  allow the parametrization of the data logger (logging intervals, temperature correction etc.) and the analysis
 *  of the logging data (visualization as plot) .
 *
 *  A DS1307 or compatible RTC IC is designed to be attached to the AVR's TWI bus, for the management of timestamps on the
 *  sampled data. This project will not function correctly if the RTC chip is omitted unless the DUMMY_RTC compile time token
 *  is specified - see \ref SSec_Options.
 *  
 *  A HTY371 sensor from Hygrosens is connected to the AVR's TWI bus for the measurement of local temperature and humidity.
 *  
 *  A RFM12 radio modul from HopeRF is connected for receiving the signals from the external radio temperature sensors. Each radio 
 *  sensor contains also a RFM12 modul and a eZ430-F2012 from TI with a MSP430F2012 as controller.
 *  
 *  A ethernet modul from Wiznet is connected to store data on a webserver in the cloud like online service Xively or Thingspeak. You
 *  can call up the data from everywhere. Data is displayed as a linechart for each logged value. In order to save energy the ethernet modul
 *  is only actived on demand from the controller.
 *
 *  Due to the host's need for exclusive access to the file system, the device will not log samples while connected to a host.
 *  For the logger to store data, the Dataflash must first be formatted by the host so that it contains a valid FAT file system.
 *
 *  This project uses the FatFS library from ELM Chan (http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) and the .NET HID device library
 *  LibHIDNet (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libhidnet/).

 *    <td>DUMMY_RTC</td>
 *    <td>Makefile LUFA_OPTS</td>
 *    <td>When a DS1307 RTC chip is not fitted, this token in the makefile can be defined to make the demo assume a 1/1/1 01:01:01 date/time
 *        stamp at all times, effectively transforming the project into a basic data logger with no specified sample times.</td>
